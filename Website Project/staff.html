        <h3>Training and Inspection</h3>
            <section>
                <p>At the Krusty Krab, we take the training and inspection of our employees very seriously. All new hires go through an extensive training program that includes learning how to maintain personal hygiene, keep their work station clean and organized, and handle emergency situations.</p>
                <p>To ensure that our employees are meeting our high standards, we conduct regular inspections. During these inspections, employees are evaluated on their ability to keep their work area clean, arrive at work on time, complete tasks assigned by their supervisor, and maintain personal hygiene.</p>
                <p>We also keep annual report cards for each employee to track their progress and identify areas for improvement. Our goal is to provide our customers with the best possible experience and that starts with having a well-trained and dedicated staff.</p>
